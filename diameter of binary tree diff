Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


  int h(TreeNode* root,int singal,int &both)
    {
        if(root==0)
            return 0;
        
      
        if(root->left==0&&root->right==0)
            return 1;
         
        int l=h(root->left,singal,both);
        int r=h(root->right,singal,both);
        
  
        both=max(both,l+r);                            // no l+1+r;
        
       
        
        
        return max(l,r)+1;                                      // no l,r+1;
        
    }
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
      
            int singal=0,both=0;
           h(root,singal,both);                            
            return both;
         
    }
